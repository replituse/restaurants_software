Enhance and finalize the existing project to ensure full responsiveness, complete functionality of all buttons and sections, and an attractive, user-friendly UI across all devices.

✅ Required Changes & Improvements

Responsive Design

Make the entire project fully responsive and compatible with mobile, tablet, laptop, and desktop devices.

Enable Export to PDF and Export to Excel features that correctly generate files based on the report data.

CRUD Functionalities (All Buttons)
