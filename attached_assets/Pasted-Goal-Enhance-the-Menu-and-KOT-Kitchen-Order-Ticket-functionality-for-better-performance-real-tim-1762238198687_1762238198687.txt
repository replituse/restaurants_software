Goal:
Enhance the Menu and KOT (Kitchen Order Ticket) functionality for better performance, real-time updates, and improved UI experience — while keeping the existing POS design consistent.

✅ Required Changes

1️⃣ Menu Section Improvements

Remove the Dish Icon from every menu item card — it should no longer be displayed.

When a user clicks on a menu item card, the item should be directly added to the order list — remove the need for a “+” or “Add” button.

Add a color indicator line on the left side of each dish card:

Red line → Non-Veg item.

Green line → Veg item.

The visual line should be subtle but clearly visible for quick differentiation.

2️⃣ KOT Section Enhancements

Add a Universal “Prepared” button at the top of the KOT section.

When clicked, it should mark all listed items as “Prepared” instantly.

Ensure that when an order (or all items) are marked as Prepared, the corresponding Table Status updates immediately in real-time:

Occupied → Food Being Prepared → Ready → Served → Free.

Fix the current issue where the table remains stuck on “Occupied” and does not transition properly.

Status changes should happen smoothly and instantly across all relevant views.

3️⃣ Page Refresh & State Management

Remove all auto page refreshes in the KOT and throughout the system.

Updating or modifying an order must not reload or refresh the page.

Instead, data should update dynamically (via state updates or API response handling).

Ensure all data updates (orders, KOT status, table states) happen without any UI reload or loss of current view.

⚙️ Expected Output

Menu items are directly clickable and instantly added to orders (no “+” button).

Veg/Non-Veg items are clearly indicated with red/green left-side lines.

KOT section includes a universal “Prepared” button that updates all items and table status together.

Table statuses update instantly and accurately without lag.

Entire POS system functions without any page reloads or refreshes during updates.

UI remains consistent and visually clean with current design.
