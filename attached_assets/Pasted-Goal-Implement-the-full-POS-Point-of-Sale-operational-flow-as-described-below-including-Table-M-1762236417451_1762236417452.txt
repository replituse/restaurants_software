Goal:
Implement the full POS (Point of Sale) operational flow as described below — including Table Management, Order Taking, KOT processing, Kitchen updates, and Billing — while keeping the existing UI design, color scheme, and layout intact. Only add missing functionalities or small UI components as needed.

✅ Detailed Functional Flow to Implement

1️⃣ Default Screen (Table Section)

The software should open directly to the “Table Section” by default.

Tables must visually indicate their current status (Free, Occupied, Preparing, Ready, Served).

2️⃣ Order Taking Flow (Dine-In)

When a user clicks on a Table, it opens the Menu window (POS/Billing screen).

The selected Table Number should be displayed clearly at the top-left corner.

Each ordered item should have:

A Note field (dropdown or text input) with options like Make it Spicy, Less Spicy, etc.

Option to add custom notes if needed.

3️⃣ KOT (Kitchen Order Ticket) Workflow

After adding all ordered items, clicking “KOT” sends the order to the KOT Section.

The KOT Section displays:

List of items ordered (with notes shown).

A timer showing time since order placed.

Status buttons: Start Preparing → Prepared → Served.

When status changes, it automatically updates the respective Table status (with different colors for each stage).

4️⃣ Table Status Flow (Dynamic Color Changes)

Free Table → Default color (e.g., gray).

Occupied (Order Taken) → Blue.

Food Preparing → Yellow.

Food Ready → Green.

Served → Light Green.

Table Free (After Bill Printed) → Back to Default.

Table must auto-update in real-time as status changes in KOT.

5️⃣ Edit Order Functionality

User should be able to edit an existing order for a table at any stage before billing.

Edited items should automatically reflect in KOT and Table section.

6️⃣ Delivery Orders

For Delivery orders:

Directly open the Menu Section.

Add items, notes, and click KOT + Print → Print the bill immediately.

No need to assign to a table.

7️⃣ Billing and Checkout

When the customer finishes dining, handler goes to Table Section, clicks that table, and:

Can view or print the bill.

Choose Split Bill or Normal Print.

Once billing is complete, the Table resets to “Free” automatically.

8️⃣ Inventory Auto-Update

Each time an order is added or items are prepared, the inventory quantity should auto-adjust accordingly (deduct used items).

Ensure this happens seamlessly in the background.

9️⃣ General Rules

Do not alter the existing UI style, colors, or design.

Only add or modify where functionality is missing.

All transitions (Table → POS → KOT → Billing) should be smooth and error-free.

Must work across all devices (responsive).

⚙️ Expected Output

A fully working POS workflow from order to billing to table reset.

Accurate real-time table status updates reflecting order progress.

Functional KOT section with timers and preparation flow.

Automatic inventory adjustments per order.

Maintained existing UI theme and color scheme with added functional improvements only.
