Objective:
Enhance UI/UX of the Table Management and Billing/POS sections for better usability, design consistency, and functionality — maintaining responsiveness and real-time updates without any refresh/reload.

TASK DETAILS
1. Table Status Flow

When an order is sent to KOT, the table color changes to red (#ff2400) and status becomes “Occupied”.

Then update status flow as:

Occupied → Preparing → Ready → Served → Available

Make sure color updates automatically and in real-time without refreshing.

Status colors:

Occupied: #ff2400 (Red)

Preparing: #fff500 (Yellow)

Ready: #3acd32 (Green)

Served: #8000ff (Purple)

Available (Free): White #ffffff with black border #000000

2. “Mark Served” Button UI Fix

See uploaded image — fix UI alignment and positioning of the “Mark Served” button.

Ensure it aligns neatly below the table circle and looks modern, centered, and properly spaced.

Maintain consistency with the theme (rounded corners, clean typography).

3. Table Design Enhancements

Add a circle outline around table labels like T1, T2, T3.

Change text from “Free” → “Available” for better clarity.

Remove the text “Floor 1 - Main Dining” entirely.

Add a black border (#000000) around all table cards.

Keep the card background white and text black.

Use hover effects for interactivity (slight shadow or scale-up).

4. Table Action Buttons

Add two small circular buttons at the bottom of each table card, similar to the 3rd uploaded image.

Button 1: Opens a popup showing order details (or “Empty” if no order).

Button 2: Redirects directly to Billing/POS section (existing navigation logic should work).

Ensure both buttons have hover states, icons, and look professional and minimalistic.

5. Billing/POS Section UI Improvements

See the 2nd uploaded image — revamp layout spacing and visual hierarchy.

Make the interface cleaner, more professional, and visually balanced.

Adjust spacing between categories, item cards, and right panel.

Keep it responsive, smooth, and easy to use.

Ensure item cards are uniform and readable on all devices.

Maintain the existing functionality (KOT, checkout, etc.) without page reload.

6. Performance and UX

Ensure all actions (like order updates, table status changes, KOT updates) happen without page refresh or reload.

Implement real-time updates using React state management or socket integration (if applicable).

Maintain smooth animations/transitions while changing states or updating data.

✅ Expected Result

A clean, responsive, and professional POS interface where:

Table statuses update instantly.

Buttons and interactions are smooth and properly aligned.

UI feels modern, consistent, and user-friendly.

No part of the app reloads or refreshes unexpectedly.
