Goal:
Redesign and improve the project’s header, sidebar, and layout structure inspired by the Petpooja UI style — clean, modern, and responsive — while keeping the mobile view intact.

✅ Required Tasks

Desktop Sidebar Hamburger Toggle

Add a hamburger icon in desktop mode (like shown in the uploaded image) to open and close the left sidebar/menu smoothly.

Do not modify the existing mobile view — it should remain as is.

Animation should be smooth, with a clean transition when toggling the sidebar.

Enhanced Header Section

Redesign the header similar to the uploaded Petpooja-style layout.

Add main quick-access buttons/tabs such as:

Purchase

HR / Staff

Analytics

Inventory

When a user clicks on any of these buttons, it should navigate/open the respective page (Purchase, HR/Staff, Analytics, Inventory).

You may also add some daily-use shortcut icons (e.g., Reports, POS, Support, Notifications) to make the header look professional and functional.

Maintain clean spacing, proper alignment, and consistent styling with modern icons and hover effects.

Sidebar Optimization

Simplify the left sidebar — avoid placing too many items that cause vertical scrolling.

Only keep major functions in the sidebar; move minor or less-used actions under other categories or dropdowns.

Make the sidebar smooth, compact, and attractive, keeping the design visually consistent with the header.

Mobile View Sidebar Behavior

In mobile view: when the hamburger menu is open, and the user clicks any menu option (like Dashboard, Tables, Settings, etc.), the sidebar should automatically close after navigation.

Maintain smooth transition and responsive behavior.

UI Reference (Petpooja Style)

Use the Petpooja design style as reference only — do not copy exactly.

Focus on achieving a professional, smooth, and elegant design with a similar layout logic and user flow.

Ensure the color scheme, icons, and typography are clean and consistent with your existing theme.

🎨 Design & UX Expectations

Modern, clean, and intuitive interface.

Smooth animations for sidebar toggle and header interactions.

Proper alignment and spacing for all header and sidebar items.

Fully responsive layout across all devices (no design break).

⚙️ Expected Output

Functional and stylish desktop hamburger sidebar toggle.

Professional Petpooja-inspired header with main navigation buttons and quick-access icons.

Optimized sidebar with minimal scroll and better usability.

Smooth mobile sidebar auto-close behavior on item click.

Overall improved responsiveness and user experience.
